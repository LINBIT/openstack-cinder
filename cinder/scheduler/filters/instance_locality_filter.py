    This filter enables selection of a storage back-end located on the host

    the instance and the volume are located on the same physical machine.

    In order to work:

    - The Extended Server Attributes extension needs to be active in Nova (this
      is by default), so that the 'OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host' property is returned
      when requesting instance info.
    - Either an account with privileged rights for Nova must be configured in
      Cinder configuration (configure a keystone authentication plugin in the
      [nova] section), or the user making the call needs to have sufficient
      rights (see 'extended_server_attributes' in Nova policy).
