===================
Dell EMC VNX driver
===================

EMC VNX driver interacts with configured VNX array. It supports
both iSCSI and FC protocol.

The VNX cinder driver performs the volume operations by
executing Navisphere CLI (NaviSecCLI) which is a command-line interface used
for management, diagnostics, and reporting functions for VNX. It also
supports both iSCSI and FC protocol.


System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- VNX Operational Environment for Block version 5.32 or higher.
- VNX Snapshot and Thin Provisioning license should be activated for VNX.
- Python library ``storops`` version 0.5.7 or higher to interact with VNX.
- Navisphere CLI v7.32 or higher is installed along with the driver.

Supported operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create, delete, attach, and detach volumes.
- Create, list, and delete volume snapshots.
- Create a volume from a snapshot.
- Copy an image to a volume.
- Clone a volume.
- Extend a volume.
- Migrate a volume.
- Retype a volume.
- Get volume statistics.
- Create and delete consistency groups.
- Create, list, and delete consistency group snapshots.
- Modify consistency groups.
- Efficient non-disruptive volume backup.
- Create a cloned consistency group.
- Create a consistency group from consistency group snapshots.
- Replication v2.1 support.
- Generic Group support.
- Revert a volume to a snapshot.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains instructions to prepare the Block Storage nodes to
use the EMC VNX driver. You should install the Navisphere CLI and ensure you
have correct zoning configurations.

Install Navisphere CLI
----------------------

Navisphere CLI needs to be installed on all Block Storage nodes within
an OpenStack deployment. You need to download different versions for
different platforms:

-  For Ubuntu x64, DEB is available at `EMC OpenStack
   Github <https://github.com/emc-openstack/naviseccli>`_.

-  For all other variants of Linux, Navisphere CLI is available at
   `Downloads for VNX2
   Series <https://support.emc.com/downloads/36656_VNX2-Series>`_ or
   `Downloads for VNX1
   Series <https://support.emc.com/downloads/12781_VNX1-Series>`_.

Install Python library storops
------------------------------

``storops`` is a Python library that interacts with VNX array through
Navisphere CLI.
Use the following command to install the ``storops`` library:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install storops

**Required software**

You can check the status of your array software in the :guilabel:`Software`
page of :guilabel:`Storage System Properties`. Here is how it looks like:

.. figure:: ../../figures/emc-enabler.png

Network configuration
---------------------

For the FC Driver, FC zoning is properly configured between the hosts and
the VNX. Check :ref:`register-fc-port-with-vnx` for reference.

For the iSCSI Driver, make sure your VNX iSCSI port is accessible by
your hosts. Check :ref:`register-iscsi-port-with-vnx` for reference.

You can use ``initiator_auto_registration = True`` configuration to avoid
registering the ports manually. Check the detail of the configuration in
:ref:`emc-vnx-conf` for reference.

If you are trying to setup multipath, refer to :ref:`multipath-setup`.


.. _emc-vnx-conf:

Back-end configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Make the following changes in the ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` file.

Minimum configuration
---------------------

Here is a sample of minimum back-end configuration. See the following sections
for the detail of each option.
Set ``storage_protocol = iscsi`` if iSCSI protocol is used.

.. code-block:: ini

   [DEFAULT]
   enabled_backends = vnx_array1

   [vnx_array1]
   san_ip = 10.10.72.41
   san_login = sysadmin
   san_password = sysadmin
   naviseccli_path = /opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli
   volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vnx.driver.VNXDriver
   initiator_auto_registration = True
   storage_protocol = fc

Multiple back-end configuration
-------------------------------
Here is a sample of a minimum back-end configuration. See following sections
for the detail of each option.
Set ``storage_protocol = iscsi`` if iSCSI protocol is used.

.. code-block:: ini

   [DEFAULT]
   enabled_backends = backendA, backendB

   [backendA]
   storage_vnx_pool_names = Pool_01_SAS, Pool_02_FLASH
   san_ip = 10.10.72.41
   storage_vnx_security_file_dir = /etc/secfile/array1
   naviseccli_path = /opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli
   volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vnx.driver.VNXDriver
   initiator_auto_registration = True
   storage_protocol = fc

   [backendB]
   storage_vnx_pool_names = Pool_02_SAS
   san_ip = 10.10.26.101
   san_login = username
   san_password = password
   naviseccli_path = /opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli
   volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vnx.driver.VNXDriver
   initiator_auto_registration = True
   storage_protocol = fc

The value of the option ``storage_protocol`` can be either ``fc`` or ``iscsi``,
which is case insensitive.

For more details on multiple back ends, see `Configure multiple-storage
back ends <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/blockstorage-multi-backend.html>`_

Required configurations
-----------------------

**IP of the VNX Storage Processors**

Specify SP A or SP B IP to connect:

.. code-block:: ini

   san_ip = <IP of VNX Storage Processor>

**VNX login credentials**

There are two ways to specify the credentials.

-  Use plain text username and password.

   Supply for plain username and password:

   .. code-block:: ini

      san_login = <VNX account with administrator role>
      san_password = <password for VNX account>
      storage_vnx_authentication_type = global

   Valid values for ``storage_vnx_authentication_type`` are: ``global``
   (default), ``local``, and ``ldap``.

-  Use Security file.

   This approach avoids the plain text password in your cinder
   configuration file. Supply a security file as below:

   .. code-block:: ini

      storage_vnx_security_file_dir = <path to security file>

Check Unisphere CLI user guide or :ref:`authenticate-by-security-file`
for how to create a security file.

**Path to your Unisphere CLI**

Specify the absolute path to your naviseccli:

.. code-block:: ini

   naviseccli_path = /opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli

**Driver's storage protocol**

-  For the FC Driver, add the following option:

   .. code-block:: ini

      volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vnx.driver.VNXDriver
      storage_protocol = fc

-  For iSCSI Driver, add the following option:

   .. code-block:: ini

      volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vnx.driver.VNXDriver
      storage_protocol = iscsi

Optional configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VNX pool names
--------------

Specify the list of pools to be managed, separated by commas. They should
already exist in VNX.

.. code-block:: ini

   storage_vnx_pool_names = pool 1, pool 2

If this value is not specified, all pools of the array will be used.

**Initiator auto registration**

When ``initiator_auto_registration`` is set to ``True``, the driver will
automatically register initiators to all working target ports of the VNX array
during volume attaching (The driver will skip those initiators that have
already been registered) if the option ``io_port_list`` is not specified in
the ``cinder.conf`` file.

If the user wants to register the initiators with some specific ports but not
register with the other ports, this functionality should be disabled.

When a comma-separated list is given to ``io_port_list``, the driver will only
register the initiator to the ports specified in the list and only return
target port(s) which belong to the target ports in the ``io_port_list`` instead
of all target ports.

-  Example for FC ports:

   .. code-block:: ini

      io_port_list = a-1,B-3

   ``a`` or ``B`` is *Storage Processor*, number ``1`` and ``3`` are
   *Port ID*.

-  Example for iSCSI ports:

   .. code-block:: ini

      io_port_list = a-1-0,B-3-0

   ``a`` or ``B`` is *Storage Processor*, the first numbers ``1`` and ``3`` are
   *Port ID* and the second number ``0`` is *Virtual Port ID*

.. note::

   -  Rather than de-registered, the registered ports will be simply
      bypassed whatever they are in ``io_port_list`` or not.

   -  The driver will raise an exception if ports in ``io_port_list``
      do not exist in VNX during startup.

Force delete volumes in storage group
-------------------------------------

Some ``available`` volumes may remain in storage group on the VNX array due to
some OpenStack timeout issue. But the VNX array do not allow the user to delete
the volumes which are in storage group. Option
``force_delete_lun_in_storagegroup`` is introduced to allow the user to delete
the ``available`` volumes in this tricky situation.

When ``force_delete_lun_in_storagegroup`` is set to ``True`` in the back-end
section, the driver will move the volumes out of the storage groups and then
delete them if the user tries to delete the volumes that remain in the storage
group on the VNX array.

The default value of ``force_delete_lun_in_storagegroup`` is ``False``.

Over subscription in thin provisioning
--------------------------------------

Over subscription allows that the sum of all volume's capacity (provisioned
capacity) to be larger than the pool's total capacity.

``max_over_subscription_ratio`` in the back-end section is the ratio of
provisioned capacity over total capacity.

The default value of ``max_over_subscription_ratio`` is 20.0, which means
the provisioned capacity can be 20 times of the total capacity.
If the value of this ratio is set larger than 1.0, the provisioned
capacity can exceed the total capacity.

Storage group automatic deletion
--------------------------------

For volume attaching, the driver has a storage group on VNX for each compute
node hosting the vm instances which are going to consume VNX Block Storage
(using compute node's host name as storage group's name).  All the volumes
attached to the VM instances in a compute node will be put into the storage
group. If ``destroy_empty_storage_group`` is set to ``True``, the driver will
remove the empty storage group after its last volume is detached. For data
safety, it does not suggest to set ``destroy_empty_storage_group=True`` unless
the VNX is exclusively managed by one Block Storage node because consistent
``lock_path`` is required for operation synchronization for this behavior.

Initiator auto deregistration
-----------------------------

Enabling storage group automatic deletion is the precondition of this function.
If ``initiator_auto_deregistration`` is set to ``True`` is set, the driver will
deregister all FC and iSCSI initiators of the host after its storage group is
deleted.

FC SAN auto zoning
------------------

The EMC VNX driver supports FC SAN auto zoning when ``ZoneManager`` is
configured and ``zoning_mode`` is set to ``fabric`` in ``cinder.conf``.
For ZoneManager configuration, refer to :doc:`../fc-zoning`.

Volume number threshold
-----------------------

In VNX, there is a limitation on the number of pool volumes that can be created
in the system. When the limitation is reached, no more pool volumes can be
created even if there is remaining capacity in the storage pool. In other
words, if the scheduler dispatches a volume creation request to a back end that
has free capacity but reaches the volume limitation, the creation fails.

The default value of ``check_max_pool_luns_threshold`` is ``False``.  When
``check_max_pool_luns_threshold=True``, the pool-based back end will check the
limit and will report 0 free capacity to the scheduler if the limit is reached.
So the scheduler will be able to skip this kind of pool-based back end that
runs out of the pool volume number.

.. note::

   From Queens, ``check_max_pool_luns_threshold`` is obsolete. And the behavior
   is like where ``check_max_pool_luns_threshold`` is set to ``True``.

iSCSI initiators
----------------

``iscsi_initiators`` is a dictionary of IP addresses of the iSCSI
initiator ports on OpenStack compute and block storage nodes which want to
connect to VNX via iSCSI. If this option is configured, the driver will
leverage this information to find an accessible iSCSI target portal for the
initiator when attaching volume. Otherwise, the iSCSI target portal will be
chosen in a relative random way.

.. note::

   This option is only valid for iSCSI driver.

Here is an example. VNX will connect ``host1`` with ``10.0.0.1`` and
``10.0.0.2``. And it will connect ``host2`` with ``10.0.0.3``.

The key name (``host1`` in the example) should be the output of
:command:`hostname` command.

.. code-block:: ini

   iscsi_initiators = {"host1":["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"],"host2":["10.0.0.3"]}

Default timeout
---------------

Specify the timeout in minutes for operations like LUN migration, LUN creation,
etc. For example, LUN migration is a typical long running operation, which
depends on the LUN size and the load of the array. An upper bound in the
specific deployment can be set to avoid unnecessary long wait.

The default value for this option is ``infinite``.

.. code-block:: ini

   default_timeout = 60

Max LUNs per storage group
--------------------------

The ``max_luns_per_storage_group`` specify the maximum number of LUNs in a
storage group. Default value is 255. It is also the maximum value supported by
VNX.

Ignore pool full threshold
--------------------------

If ``ignore_pool_full_threshold`` is set to ``True``, driver will force LUN
creation even if the full threshold of pool is reached. Default to ``False``.

Extra spec options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra specs are used in volume types created in Block Storage as the preferred
property of the volume.

The Block Storage scheduler will use extra specs to find the suitable back end
for the volume and the Block Storage driver will create the volume based on the
properties specified by the extra spec.

Use the following command to create a volume type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume type create demoVolumeType

Use the following command to update the extra spec of a volume type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=thin --property thick_provisioning_support='<is> True' demoVolumeType

The following sections describe the VNX extra keys.

Provisioning type
-----------------

-  Key: ``provisioning:type``

-  Possible Values:

   -  ``thick``

      Volume is fully provisioned.

      Run the following commands to create a ``thick`` volume type:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ openstack volume type create ThickVolumeType
         $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=thick --property thick_provisioning_support='<is> True' ThickVolumeType

   -  ``thin``

      Volume is virtually provisioned.

      Run the following commands to create a ``thin`` volume type:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ openstack volume type create ThinVolumeType
         $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=thin --property thin_provisioning_support='<is> True' ThinVolumeType

   -  ``deduplicated``

      Volume is ``thin`` and deduplication is enabled. The administrator shall
      go to VNX to configure the system level deduplication settings. To
      create a deduplicated volume, the VNX Deduplication license must be
      activated on VNX, and specify ``deduplication_support=True`` to let Block
      Storage scheduler find the proper volume back end.

      Run the following commands to create a ``deduplicated`` volume type:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ openstack volume type create DeduplicatedVolumeType
         $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=deduplicated --property deduplicated_support='<is> True' DeduplicatedVolumeType

   -  ``compressed``

      Volume is ``thin`` and compression is enabled. The administrator shall go
      to the VNX to configure the system level compression settings. To create
      a compressed volume, the VNX Compression license must be activated on
      VNX, and use ``compression_support=True`` to let Block Storage scheduler
      find a volume back end. VNX does not support creating snapshots on a
      compressed volume.

      Run the following commands to create a ``compressed`` volume type:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ openstack volume type create CompressedVolumeType
         $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=compressed --property compression_support='<is> True' CompressedVolumeType

-  Default: ``thick``

.. note::

   ``provisioning:type`` replaces the old spec key ``storagetype:provisioning``.
   The latter one is obsolete since the *Mitaka* release.

Storage tiering support
-----------------------

- Key: ``storagetype:tiering``
- Possible values:

  - ``StartHighThenAuto``
  - ``Auto``
  - ``HighestAvailable``
  - ``LowestAvailable``
  - ``NoMovement``

- Default: ``StartHighThenAuto``

VNX supports fully automated storage tiering which requires the FAST license
activated on the VNX. The OpenStack administrator can use the extra spec key
``storagetype:tiering`` to set the tiering policy of a volume and use the key
``fast_support='<is> True'`` to let Block Storage scheduler find a volume back
end which manages a VNX with FAST license activated. Here are the five
supported values for the extra spec key ``storagetype:tiering``:

Run the following commands to create a volume type with tiering policy:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume type create ThinVolumeOnAutoTier
   $ openstack volume type set --property provisioning:type=thin --property storagetype:tiering=Auto --property fast_support='<is> True' ThinVolumeOnAutoTier

.. note::

   The tiering policy cannot be applied to a deduplicated volume. Tiering
   policy of the deduplicated LUN align with the settings of the pool.

FAST cache support
------------------

-  Key: ``fast_cache_enabled``

-  Possible values:

   -  ``True``

   -  ``False``

-  Default: ``False``

VNX has FAST Cache feature which requires the FAST Cache license activated on
the VNX. Volume will be created on the backend with FAST cache enabled when
``<is> True`` is specified.

Pool name
---------

-  Key: ``pool_name``

-  Possible values: name of the storage pool managed by cinder

-  Default: None

If the user wants to create a volume on a certain storage pool in a back end
that manages multiple pools, a volume type with a extra spec specified storage
pool should be created first, then the user can use this volume type to create
the volume.

Run the following commands to create the volume type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume type create HighPerf
   $ openstack volume type set --property pool_name=Pool_02_SASFLASH --property volume_backend_name=vnx_41 HighPerf

Obsolete extra specs
--------------------

.. note::

   *DO NOT* use the following obsolete extra spec keys:

   - ``storagetype:provisioning``
   - ``storagetype:pool``

Force detach
------------

The user could use `os-force_detach` action to detach a volume from all its attached hosts.
For more detail, please refer to
https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v2/?expanded=force-detach-volume-detail#force-detach-volume


Advanced features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snap copy
---------

- Metadata Key: ``snapcopy``
- Possible Values:

  - ``True`` or ``true``
  - ``False`` or ``false``

- Default: `False`

VNX driver supports snap copy which accelerates the process for
creating a copied volume.

By default, the driver will use `asynchronous migration support`_, which will
start a VNX migration session. When snap copy is used, driver creates a
snapshot and mounts it as a volume for the 2 kinds of operations which will be
instant even for large volumes.

To enable this functionality, append ``--metadata snapcopy=True``
when creating cloned volume or creating volume from snapshot.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder create --source-volid <source-void> --name "cloned_volume" --metadata snapcopy=True

Or

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder create --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> --name "vol_from_snapshot" --metadata snapcopy=True


The newly created volume is a snap copy instead of
a full copy. If a full copy is needed, retype or migrate can be used
to convert the snap-copy volume to a full-copy volume which may be
time-consuming.

You can determine whether the volume is a snap-copy volume or not by
showing its metadata. If the ``snapcopy`` in metadata is ``True`` or ``true``,
the volume is a snap-copy volume. Otherwise, it is a full-copy volume.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder metadata-show <volume>

**Constraints**

- The number of snap-copy volumes created from a single source volume is
  limited to 255 at one point in time.
- The source volume which has snap-copy volume can not be deleted or migrated.
- snapcopy volume will be change to full-copy volume after host-assisted or
  storage-assisted migration.
- snapcopy volume can not be added to consisgroup because of VNX limitation.

Efficient non-disruptive volume backup
--------------------------------------

The default implementation in Block Storage for non-disruptive volume backup is
not efficient since a cloned volume will be created during backup.

The approach of efficient backup is to create a snapshot for the volume and
connect this snapshot (a mount point in VNX) to the Block Storage host for
volume backup. This eliminates migration time involved in volume clone.

**Constraints**

-  Backup creation for a snap-copy volume is not allowed if the volume
   status is ``in-use`` since snapshot cannot be taken from this volume.

Configurable migration rate
---------------------------

VNX cinder driver is leveraging the LUN migration from the VNX. LUN migration
is involved in cloning, migrating, retyping, and creating volume from snapshot.
When admin set ``migrate_rate`` in volume's ``metadata``, VNX driver can start
migration with specified rate. The available values for the ``migrate_rate``
are ``high``, ``asap``, ``low`` and ``medium``.

The following is an example to set ``migrate_rate`` to ``asap``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder metadata <volume-id> set migrate_rate=asap

After set, any cinder volume operations involving VNX LUN migration will
take the value as the migration rate. To restore the migration rate to
default, unset the metadata as following:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder metadata <volume-id> unset migrate_rate

.. note::

   Do not use the ``asap`` migration rate when the system is in production, as the normal
   host I/O may be interrupted. Use asap only when the system is offline
   (free of any host-level I/O).

Replication v2.1 support
------------------------

Cinder introduces Replication v2.1 support in Mitaka, it supports
fail-over and fail-back replication for specific back end. In VNX cinder
driver, **MirrorView** is used to set up replication for the volume.

To enable this feature, you need to set configuration in ``cinder.conf`` as
below:

.. code-block:: ini

   replication_device = backend_id:<secondary VNX serial number>,
                        san_ip:192.168.1.2,
                        san_login:admin,
                        san_password:admin,
                        naviseccli_path:/opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli,
                        storage_vnx_authentication_type:global,
                        storage_vnx_security_file_dir:

Currently, only synchronized mode **MirrorView** is supported, and one volume
can only have 1 secondary storage system. Therefore, you can have only one
``replication_device`` presented in driver configuration section.

To create a replication enabled volume, you need to create a volume type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume type create replication-type
   $ openstack volume type set --property replication_enabled="<is> True" replication-type

And then create volume with above volume type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack volume create replication-volume --type replication-type --size 1

**Supported operations**

- Create volume
- Create cloned volume
- Create volume from snapshot
- Fail-over volume:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ cinder failover-host --backend_id <secondary VNX serial number> <hostname>

- Fail-back volume:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ cinder failover-host --backend_id default <hostname>

**Requirements**

- 2 VNX systems must be in same domain.
- For iSCSI MirrorView, user needs to setup iSCSI connection before enable
  replication in Cinder.
- For FC MirrorView, user needs to zone specific FC ports from 2
  VNX system together.
- MirrorView Sync enabler( **MirrorView/S** ) installed on both systems.
- Write intent log enabled on both VNX systems.

For more information on how to configure, please refer to: `MirrorView-Knowledgebook:-Releases-30-–-33 <https://support.emc.com/docu32906_MirrorView-Knowledgebook:-Releases-30-%E2%80%93-33---A-Detailed-Review.pdf?language=en_US>`_

Asynchronous migration support
------------------------------

VNX Cinder driver now supports asynchronous migration during volume cloning.

The driver now using asynchronous migration when creating a volume from source
as the default cloning method. The driver will return immediately after the
migration session starts on the VNX, which dramatically reduces the time before
a volume is available for use.

To disable this feature, user can add ``--metadata async_migrate=False`` when
creating new volume from source.

**Constraints**

- Before the migration finishes, snapshots cannot be created from the source
  volume, which could affect subsequent clones from the same source volume.
  The typical affected use case is that creating volume-2 via cloning
  volume-1 immediately after creating volume-1 via cloning volume-0. To achieve
  so, users are advised to take any one of below actions:

  1) wait for the first clone finishing, or
  2) create volume-2 via cloning volume-0 instead of volume-1, or
  3) create volume-1 with ``--metadata async_migrate=False``.


Best practice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _multipath-setup:

Multipath setup
---------------

Enabling multipath volume access is recommended for robust data access.
The major configuration includes:

#. Install ``multipath-tools``, ``sysfsutils`` and ``sg3-utils`` on the
   nodes hosting compute and ``cinder-volume`` services. Check
   the operating system manual for the system distribution for specific
   installation steps. For Red Hat based distributions, they should be
   ``device-mapper-multipath``, ``sysfsutils`` and ``sg3_utils``.

#. Specify ``use_multipath_for_image_xfer=true`` in the ``cinder.conf`` file
   for each FC/iSCSI back end.

#. Specify ``volume_use_multipath=True`` in ``libvirt`` section of the
   ``nova.conf`` file. This option is valid for both iSCSI and FC driver.
   In versions prior to Newton, the option was called ``iscsi_use_multipath``.

For multipath-tools, here is an EMC recommended sample of
``/etc/multipath.conf`` file.

``user_friendly_names`` is not specified in the configuration and thus
it will take the default value ``no``. It is not recommended to set it
to ``yes`` because it may fail operations such as VM live migration.

.. code-block:: vim

   blacklist {
       # Skip the files under /dev that are definitely not FC/iSCSI devices
       # Different system may need different customization
       devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
       devnode "^hd[a-z][0-9]*"
       devnode "^cciss!c[0-9]d[0-9]*[p[0-9]*]"

       # Skip LUNZ device from VNX
       device {
           vendor "DGC"
           product "LUNZ"
           }
   }

   defaults {
       user_friendly_names no
       flush_on_last_del yes
   }

   devices {
       # Device attributed for EMC CLARiiON and VNX series ALUA
       device {
           vendor "DGC"
           product ".*"
           product_blacklist "LUNZ"
           path_grouping_policy group_by_prio
           path_selector "round-robin 0"
           path_checker emc_clariion
           features "1 queue_if_no_path"
           hardware_handler "1 alua"
           prio alua
           failback immediate
       }
   }

.. note::

   When multipath is used in OpenStack, multipath faulty devices may
   come out in Nova-Compute nodes due to different issues (`Bug
   1336683 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1336683>`_ is a
   typical example).

A solution to completely avoid faulty devices has not been found yet.
``faulty_device_cleanup.py`` mitigates this issue when VNX iSCSI storage is
used. Cloud administrators can deploy the script in all Nova-Compute nodes and
use a CRON job to run the script on each Nova-Compute node periodically so that
faulty devices will not stay too long. Refer to: `VNX faulty device
cleanup <https://github.com/emc-openstack/vnx-faulty-device-cleanup>`_ for
detailed usage and the script.

Restrictions and limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

iSCSI port cache
----------------

EMC VNX iSCSI driver caches the iSCSI ports information, so that the user
should restart the ``cinder-volume`` service or wait for seconds (which is
configured by ``periodic_interval`` in the ``cinder.conf`` file) before any
volume attachment operation after changing the iSCSI port configurations.
Otherwise the attachment may fail because the old iSCSI port configurations
were used.

No extending for volume with snapshots
--------------------------------------

VNX does not support extending the thick volume which has a snapshot. If the
user tries to extend a volume which has a snapshot, the status of the volume
would change to ``error_extending``.

Limitations for deploying cinder on computer node
-------------------------------------------------

It is not recommended to deploy the driver on a compute node if ``cinder
upload-to-image --force True`` is used against an in-use volume. Otherwise,
``cinder upload-to-image --force True`` will terminate the data access of the
vm instance to the volume.

Storage group with host names in VNX
------------------------------------

When the driver notices that there is no existing storage group that has the
host name as the storage group name, it will create the storage group and also
add the compute node's or Block Storage node's registered initiators into the
storage group.

If the driver notices that the storage group already exists, it will assume
that the registered initiators have also been put into it and skip the
operations above for better performance.

It is recommended that the storage administrator does not create the storage
group manually and instead relies on the driver for the preparation. If the
storage administrator needs to create the storage group manually for some
special requirements, the correct registered initiators should be put into the
storage group as well (otherwise the following volume attaching operations will
fail).

EMC storage-assisted volume migration
-------------------------------------

EMC VNX driver supports storage-assisted volume migration, when the user starts
migrating with ``cinder migrate --force-host-copy False <volume_id> <host>`` or
``cinder migrate <volume_id> <host>``, cinder will try to leverage the VNX's
native volume migration functionality.

In following scenarios, VNX storage-assisted volume migration will not be
triggered:

- ``in-use`` volume migration between back ends with different storage
  protocol, for example, FC and iSCSI.
- Volume is to be migrated across arrays.

.. _authenticate-by-security-file:

Authenticate by security file
-----------------------------

VNX credentials are necessary when the driver connects to the VNX system.
Credentials in ``global``, ``local`` and ``ldap`` scopes are supported. There
are two approaches to provide the credentials.

The recommended one is using the Navisphere CLI security file to provide the
credentials which can get rid of providing the plain text credentials in the
configuration file. Following is the instruction on how to do this.

#. Find out the Linux user id of the ``cinder-volume`` processes. Assuming the
   ``cinder-volume`` service is running by the account ``cinder``.

#. Run ``su`` as root user.

#. In ``/etc/passwd`` file, change
   ``cinder:x:113:120::/var/lib/cinder:/bin/false``
   to ``cinder:x:113:120::/var/lib/cinder:/bin/bash`` (This temporary change is
   to make step 4 work.)

#. Save the credentials on behalf of ``cinder`` user to a security file
   (assuming the array credentials are ``admin/admin`` in ``global`` scope). In
   the command below, the ``-secfilepath`` switch is used to specify the
   location to save the security file.

   .. code-block:: console

      # su -l cinder -c \
        '/opt/Navisphere/bin/naviseccli -AddUserSecurity -user admin -password admin -scope 0 -secfilepath <location>'

#. Change ``cinder:x:113:120::/var/lib/cinder:/bin/bash`` back to
   ``cinder:x:113:120::/var/lib/cinder:/bin/false`` in ``/etc/passwd`` file.

#. Remove the credentials options ``san_login``, ``san_password`` and
   ``storage_vnx_authentication_type`` from ``cinder.conf`` file. (normally
   it is ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` file). Add option
   ``storage_vnx_security_file_dir`` and set its value to the directory path of
   your security file generated in the above step. Omit this option if
   ``-secfilepath`` is not used in the above step.

#. Restart the ``cinder-volume`` service to validate the change.


.. _register-fc-port-with-vnx:

Register FC port with VNX
-------------------------

This configuration is only required when ``initiator_auto_registration=False``.

To access VNX storage, the Compute nodes should be registered on VNX first if
initiator auto registration is not enabled.

To perform ``Copy Image to Volume`` and ``Copy Volume to Image`` operations,
the nodes running the ``cinder-volume`` service (Block Storage nodes) must be
registered with the VNX as well.

The steps mentioned below are for the compute nodes. Follow the same
steps for the Block Storage nodes also (The steps can be skipped if initiator
auto registration is enabled).

#. Assume ``20:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2:21:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2`` is the WWN of a
   FC initiator port name of the compute node whose host name and IP are
   ``myhost1`` and ``10.10.61.1``. Register
   ``20:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2:21:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2`` in Unisphere:

#. Log in to :guilabel:`Unisphere`, go to
   :menuselection:`FNM0000000000 > Hosts > Initiators`.

#. Refresh and wait until the initiator
   ``20:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2:21:00:00:24:FF:48:BA:C2`` with SP Port ``A-1``
   appears.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Register` button, select :guilabel:`CLARiiON/VNX`
   and enter the host name (which is the output of the :command:`hostname`
   command) and IP address:

   -  Hostname: ``myhost1``

   -  IP: ``10.10.61.1``

   -  Click :guilabel:`Register`.

#. Then host ``10.10.61.1`` will appear under
   :menuselection:`Hosts > Host List` as well.

#. Register the ``wwn`` with more ports if needed.

.. _register-iscsi-port-with-vnx:

Register iSCSI port with VNX
----------------------------

This configuration is only required when ``initiator_auto_registration=False``.

To access VNX storage, the compute nodes should be registered on VNX first if
initiator auto registration is not enabled.

To perform ``Copy Image to Volume`` and ``Copy Volume to Image`` operations,
the nodes running the ``cinder-volume`` service (Block Storage nodes) must be
registered with the VNX as well.

The steps mentioned below are for the compute nodes. Follow the
same steps for the Block Storage nodes also (The steps can be skipped if
initiator auto registration is enabled).

#. On the compute node with IP address ``10.10.61.1`` and host name ``myhost1``,
   execute the following commands (assuming ``10.10.61.35`` is the iSCSI
   target):

   #. Start the iSCSI initiator service on the node:

      .. code-block:: console

         # /etc/init.d/open-iscsi start

   #. Discover the iSCSI target portals on VNX:

      .. code-block:: console

         # iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p 10.10.61.35

   #. Change directory to ``/etc/iscsi`` :

      .. code-block:: console

         # cd /etc/iscsi

   #. Find out the ``iqn`` of the node:

      .. code-block:: console

         # more initiatorname.iscsi

#. Log in to :guilabel:`VNX` from the compute node using the target
   corresponding to the SPA port:

   .. code-block:: console

      # iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.1992-04.com.emc:cx.apm01234567890.a0 -p 10.10.61.35 -l

#. Assume ``iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:1a2b3c4d5f6g`` is the initiator name of
   the compute node. Register ``iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:1a2b3c4d5f6g`` in
   Unisphere:

   #. Log in to :guilabel:`Unisphere`, go to
      :menuselection:`FNM0000000000 > Hosts > Initiators`.

   #. Refresh and wait until the initiator
      ``iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:1a2b3c4d5f6g`` with SP Port ``A-8v0``
      appears.

   #. Click the :guilabel:`Register` button, select :guilabel:`CLARiiON/VNX`
      and enter the host name
      (which is the output of the :command:`hostname` command) and IP address:

      -  Hostname: ``myhost1``

      -  IP: ``10.10.61.1``

      -  Click :guilabel:`Register`.

   #. Then host ``10.10.61.1`` will appear under
      :menuselection:`Hosts > Host List` as well.

#. Log out :guilabel:`iSCSI` on the node:

   .. code-block:: console

      # iscsiadm -m node -u

#. Log in to :guilabel:`VNX` from the compute node using the target
   corresponding to the SPB port:

   .. code-block:: console

      # iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.1992-04.com.emc:cx.apm01234567890.b8 -p 10.10.61.36 -l

#. In ``Unisphere``, register the initiator with the SPB port.

#. Log out :guilabel:`iSCSI` on the node:

   .. code-block:: console

      # iscsiadm -m node -u

#. Register the ``iqn`` with more ports if needed.
