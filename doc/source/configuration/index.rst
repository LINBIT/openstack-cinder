   The examples of common configurations for shared
   service and libraries, such as database connections and
   RPC messaging, can be seen in Cinder's sample configuration
   file: `cinder.conf.sample <../_static/cinder.conf.sample>`_.

The Block Storage service works with many different storage
drivers that you can configure by using these instructions.
