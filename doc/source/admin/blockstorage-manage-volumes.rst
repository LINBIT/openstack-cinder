Manage volumes
==============

The default OpenStack Block Storage service implementation is an
iSCSI solution that uses :term:`Logical Volume Manager (LVM)` for Linux.

.. note::

   The OpenStack Block Storage service also provides drivers that
   enable you to use several vendors' back-end storage devices in
   addition to the base LVM implementation.  These storage devices can
   also be used instead of the base LVM installation.

This high-level procedure shows you how to create and attach a volume
to a server instance.

**To create and attach a volume to an instance**

#. Configure the OpenStack Compute and the OpenStack Block Storage
   services through the ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` file.
#. Use the :command:`openstack volume create` command to create a volume.
   This command creates an LV into the volume group (VG) ``cinder-volumes``.
#. Use the :command:`openstack server add volume` command to attach the
   volume to an instance. This command creates a unique :term:`IQN <iSCSI
   Qualified Name (IQN)>` that is exposed to the compute node.

   * The compute node, which runs the instance, now has an active
     iSCSI session and new local storage (usually a ``/dev/sdX``
     disk).
   * Libvirt uses that local storage as storage for the instance. The
     instance gets a new disk (usually a ``/dev/vdX`` disk).

For this particular walkthrough, one cloud controller runs
``nova-api``, ``nova-scheduler``, ``nova-conductor`` and ``cinder-*``
services. Two additional compute nodes run ``nova-compute``. The walkthrough
uses a custom partitioning scheme that carves out 60 GB of space and labels it
as LVM. The network uses the ``FlatManager`` and ``NetworkManager``
settings for OpenStack Compute.

The network mode does not interfere with OpenStack Block Storage
operations, but you must set up networking for Block Storage to work.
For details, see `networking`_.

To set up Compute to use volumes, ensure that Block Storage is
installed along with ``lvm2``. This guide describes how to
troubleshoot your installation and back up your Compute volumes.
