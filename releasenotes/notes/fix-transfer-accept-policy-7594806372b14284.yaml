    `Bug #1950474 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1950474>`_: Fixed
    policy authorization for transfer accept API. Previously, if an operator
    had overridden the default transfer accept policy to something project
    specific in policy.yaml file, it would break the transfer accept API
    which is fixed in this release.
