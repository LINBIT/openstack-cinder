    Added vSphere storage policy support in VMwareVStorageObjectDriver.
    The storage policies that must be associated with the volumes can
    be specified using volume type extra-spec key 'vmware:storage_profile'
    similar to VMware VMDK driver. The vSphere version must be 6.7 or
    above to use this feature.
