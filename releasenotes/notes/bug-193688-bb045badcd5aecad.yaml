    `Bug #1935688 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1935688>`_:
    Cinder only supports uploading a volume of an encrypted volume type as an
    image to the Image service in ``raw`` format using a ``bare`` container
    type.  Previously, ``os-volume_upload_image`` action requests to the Block
    Storage API specifying different format option values were accepted, but
    would result in a later failure.  This condition is now checked at the API
    layer, and ``os-volume_upload_image`` action requests on a volume of an
    encrypted type that specify unsupported values for ``disk_format`` or
    ``container_format`` now result in a 400 (Bad Request) response.
