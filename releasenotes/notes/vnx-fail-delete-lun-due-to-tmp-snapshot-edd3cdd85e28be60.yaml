    Dell EMC VNX Cinder Driver: Fixes `bug 1794646
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1794646>`__ to delete the LUN from
    the VNX storage. Because a temporary snapshot is created from the LUN
    during creating a volume from a snapshot and isn't deleted, the LUN cannot
    be deleted before its snapshot is deleted. The fix makes sure the temp
    snapshot is deleted.
