upgrade:
  - Default behavior of ceph backups upgraded (no longer incremental by
    default) to keep consistency between drivers.
fixes:
  - Volume backup service with Ceph driver will now respect the `--incremental`
    option for backups (this new behavior will be only available for Ceph
    volumes, we still don't support incremental for non Ceph volumes).
    If the incremental flag is not specified then a new full backup will
    always be created.
