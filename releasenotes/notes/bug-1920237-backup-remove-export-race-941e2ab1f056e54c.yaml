    `Bug #1920237 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1920237>`_: The
    backup manager calls volume remove_export() but does not wait for it to
    complete when detaching a volume after backup.  This caused problems
    when a subsequent operation started on that volume before it had fully
    detached.
