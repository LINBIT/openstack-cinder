    The HGST Flash Suite storage driver has been removed after completion
    of its deprecation period without a reliable 3rd Party CI system being
    supported.  Customers using the HGST Flash Suite driver should not upgrade
    Cinder without first migrating all volumes from their HGST backend
    to a supported storage backend.  Failure to migrate volumes will
    result in no longer being able to access volumes backed by the HGST
    storage backend.

    The HGST Flash Storage Suite Driver was marked unsupported
    in the Rocky release because their 3rd Party CI system was not
    meeting Cinder's requirements.  The system has not started reporting
    so the driver is now removed as of the Stein release.
