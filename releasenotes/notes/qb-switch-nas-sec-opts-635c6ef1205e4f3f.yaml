    In order to simplify initial setup for new installations
    the default behaviour of the Quobyte driver for the options
    ``nas_secure_file_operations`` and ``nas_secure_file_permissions``
    has changed.
    The 'auto' values are no longer mapped to true but to false. Therefore
    the old default behaviour to run with secure settings is changed
    to run without secure settings as the new default behaviour.
    Installations using the default values for these options should ensure
    to explicitly set them to true with this new Cinder Quobyte driver
    version.
