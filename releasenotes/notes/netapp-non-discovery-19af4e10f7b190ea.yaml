    NetApp iSCSI drivers no longer use the discovery mechanism for multipathing
    and they always return all target/portals when attaching a volume.  Thanks
    to this, volumes will be successfully attached even if the target/portal
    selected as primary is down, this will be the case for both, multipath and
    single path connections.
