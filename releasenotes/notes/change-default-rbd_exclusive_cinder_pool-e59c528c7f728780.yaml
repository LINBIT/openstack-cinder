upgrade:
  - |
    Ceph/RBD volume backends will now assume exclusive cinder pools, as if they
    had ``rbd_exclusive_cinder_pool = true`` in their configuration.

    This helps deployments with a large number of volumes and prevent issues on
    deployments with a growing number of volumes at the small cost of a
    slightly less accurate stats being reported to the scheduler.
fixes:
  - |
    Ceph/RBD: Fix cinder taking a long time to start for Ceph/RBD backends.
    (`Related-Bug #1704106 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1704106>`_)

    Ceph/RBD: Fix Cinder becoming non-responsive and stats gathering taking
    longer that its period. (`Related-Bug #1704106
