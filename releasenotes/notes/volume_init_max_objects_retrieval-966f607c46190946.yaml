upgrade:
  - Volume Manager now uses the configuration option
    ``init_host_max_objects`` retrieval to set max number of
    volumes and snapshots to be retrieved per batch during
    volume manager host initialization. Query results will
    be obtained in batches from the database and not in one
    shot to avoid extreme memory usage.
    Default value is 0 and disables this functionality.
