features:
  - Added an ``excluded_domain_ips`` option to the Dell EMC SC driver. This
    is identical to the excluded_domain_ip option only comma separated
    rather than multiple entry. This is concatenated with the
    ``excluded_domain_ip`` option.
deprecations:
  - |
    The Dell EMC SC configuration option ``excluded_domain_ip`` has
    been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Deployments should
    now migrate to the option ``excluded_domain_ips`` for equivalent
    functionality.
