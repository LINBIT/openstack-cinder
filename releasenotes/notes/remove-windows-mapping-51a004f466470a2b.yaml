upgrade:

    The ``WindowsDriver`` was renamed in the Queens release to
    ``WindowsISCSIDriver`` to avoid confusion with the SMB driver. The
    backwards compatibility for this has now been removed, so any cinder.conf
    settings still using
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.windows.windows.WindowsDriver`` must now be updated
    to use ``cinder.volume.drivers.windows.iscsi.WindowsISCSIDriver``.
