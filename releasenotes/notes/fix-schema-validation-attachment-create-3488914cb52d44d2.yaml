    Fixed the schema validation for attachment create API
    to make instance uuid an optional field. It had mistakenly
    been defined as a required field when schema validation
    was added in an earlier release.
    Also updated the schema to allow specification of the ``mode``
    parameter, which has been available since microversion >= 3.54,
    but which was not recognized as a legitimate request field.
