features:
  - RBD driver has added multiattach support.  It should be noted that
    replication and multiattach are mutually exclusive, so a single RBD
    volume can only be configured to support one of these features at a
    time.  Additionally, RBD image features are not preserved which
    prevents a volume being retyped from multiattach to another type.
    This limitation is temporary and will be addressed soon.
