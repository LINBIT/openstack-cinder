fixes:
  - PowerMax driver - Workload support was dropped in ucode 5978. If a
    VMAX All Flash array is upgraded to 5978 or greater and existing
    volume types leveraged workload e.g. DSS, DSS_REP, OLTP and OLTP_REP,
    certain operations will no longer work and the volume type will be
    unusable. This fix addresses these issues and fixes problems with
    using old volume types with workloads included in the volume type
    pool_name.
