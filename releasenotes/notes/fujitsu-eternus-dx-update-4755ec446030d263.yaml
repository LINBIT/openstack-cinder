upgrade:
  - The Fujitsu DX driver names have been updated to distinguish
    them from other Fujitsu storage. The module path
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.fujitsu`` should now be updated to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.fujitsu.eternus_dx`` in ``cinder.conf``.
    Support for the previous driver naming will continue to work,
    but will be removed in a future release.
