    `Bug #1898075
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1898075>`_: When Glance added
    support for multiple cinder stores, Images API version 2.11 modified
    the format of the image location URI, which Cinder reads in order
    to try to use an optimized data path when creating a volume from an
    image.  Unfortunately, Cinder did not understand the new format and
    when Glance multiple cinder stores were used, Cinder could not use
    the optimized data path, and instead downloaded image data from
    the Image service.  Cinder now supports Images API version 2.11.
