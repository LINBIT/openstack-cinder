    Removed the ability to create volumes in a ScaleIO Storage Pool that has
    zero-padding disabled. A new configuration option
    ``sio_allow_non_padded_volumes`` has been added to override this new
    behavior and allow unpadded volumes, but should not be enabled if multiple
    tenants will utilize volumes from a shared Storage Pool.
