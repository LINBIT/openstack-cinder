  - |
    The ITRI DISCO storage driver has been removed after completion of its
    deprecation period without a reliable 3rd Party CI system being
    supported.  Customers using the ITRI DISCO driver should not upgrade
    Cinder without first migrating all volumes from their DISCO backend
    to a supported storage backend.  Failure to migrate volumes will
    result in no longer being able to access volumes back by the ITRI DISCO
    storage backend.

    The ITRI DISCO storage driver was marked unsupported  in Rocky due to
    3rd Party CI not meeting Cinder's requirements.  As a result the
    driver is removed starting from the Stein release.
