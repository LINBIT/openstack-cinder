    Removed the ability to create volumes in a ScaleIO Storage Pool
    that has zero-padding disabled.
    A new configuration option had been added to override this new
    behavior and allow volume creation, but should not be enabled if
    multiple tenants will utilize volumes from a shared Storage Pool.
