fixes:
  - When using a PowerMax OS array as a replication target, where the source is
    an All-Flash/Hybrid array running HyperMax OS, service level and workload
    settings are not correctly applied for devices on the replication target if
    a workload is specified. Instead of setting only the workload to None, both
    service level and workload are set to None. This fix corrects the
    application of service level and workload settings for replication sessions
    where the source is HyperMax OS and the target is PowerMax OS.
