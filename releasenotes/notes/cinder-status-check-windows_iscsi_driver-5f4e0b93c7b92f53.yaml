    A new check is added to the ``cinder-status upgrade check`` CLI to check
    for the use of ``cinder.volume.drivers.windows.windows.WindowsDriver``
    and a message is reported that the user needs to update the setting
    to ``cinder.volume.drivers.windows.iscsi.WindowsISCSIDriver`` if
    it is encountered.
