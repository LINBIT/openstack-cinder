    Added a new option ``quobyte_overlay_volumes`` for the Quobyte
    volume driver. This option activates internal snapshots who allow
    to create volumes from snapshots as overlay files based on the
    volume from snapshot cache. This significantly speeds up the
    creation of volumes from large snapshots.
