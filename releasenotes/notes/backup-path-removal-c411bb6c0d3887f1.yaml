upgrade:
  - |
    The ability to specify a backup driver by module name was deprecated in
    the Queens release and the ability has now been removed. Any configuration
    in cinder.conf still using the module path should be updated to include the
    full class name. For example, ``cinder.backup.drivers.swift`` should be
    updated to ``cinder.backup.drivers.swift.SwiftBackupDriver``.
